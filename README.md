# About

**Library** is a web app writen in JavaScript that lets users keep track of their favourite books and whether they've read them or not.

It displays book data including the title, author, number of pages and read status, and offers buttons to toggle read status and delete books.

The app also allows saving data in the cloud using Firebase and allows users to sign in using their google accounts. If the user isn't signed in, it uses localStorage to save data in the device, but localStorage isn't reliable and can be lost.

## Built with

This app is built without using any frameworks, only:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
